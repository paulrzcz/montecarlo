# Monte Carlo Stochastic Process library #

The intent of this library is to provide Monte Carlo calculations on stochastic processes.
The library is used in my internal projects quite extensively and steady updates are provided.

The main features are:
* Parallelized execution
* Stochastic processes: single and multiple dimensional
* Optimized normal random number generators
* Several variance reduction technics are supported: antithetic paths, low discrepancy Sobol generator and brownian bridge
* Maximum Likelihood estimation by Monte Carlo probability sampling
